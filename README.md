##	About ChatElite

**ChatElite** is a web application that provides peer-to-peer and group chat. ChatElite is developed using Node.js and Mongo DB for database. ChatElite can be used as pluggable chat tool by using collapsed mode. This mode can be used to integrate ChatElite with another web-based application.

*	**Add users to group**: Once a group is formed, user can add new users to the group.
*	**Remove users from group**: From a group, user can remove certain users.
*	**Leave group**: If user is added to certain ChatElite group and doesn‚Äôt wish to be a part of it anymore, he can leave the group. 
*	**Search for a keyword in chat**: User can search for a keyword within a chat.

##	System Design

### Architecture
![System architecture](./systemArchitecture.png)

### Web-UI repository structure

![Repository structure](./webUIStructure.png)

This repository contains the code for UI which includes HTML and view-related files. The web-UI repository has src folder which contains all components in the ts typescript format.
 
The **SCSS folder** contains the general and theme-related stylesheet files which after compilation are converted to CSS files. The external CSS files are also imported. 

The **TS folder** contains typescript files for web-UI components which after compilation are converted to js files. It consists of globally declared variables, HTML codes, controller, components, services, interfaces, enums, configuration files, constants, decorators, external files.

The **Typings folder** contains package typings. 

**entry.ts**: All files from different packages are imported here.
**bundle.test.js**: It includes test cases.
**Karma.conf.js**: It includes configuration settings for karma. 

Different loaders are used by webpack to compile the code. The compiler will create bundled JavaScript file.

Start the UI application using NPM start.

###	Repositories

1.	**T-web API**: This repository contains the wrapper methods and framework code which includes socket related methods, server connection and express connection. User has to create instances of classes mentioned in T-web API.
2.	**ChatEliteService**: This repository contains the server-side code which includes business logic, database queries, Socket APIs, REST APIs and API call execution methods.The documentation for this repository is available [here](https://xoriantopensource.github.io/ChatEliteService/).
3.	**ChatEliteUi**: This repository contains the code for UI which includes HTML and view-related files.The documentation for this repository is available [here](https://xoriantopensource.github.io/ChatEliteUi/).

* Before execution on localhost install - 
  * **typescript** using following command : **typescript** is used to compile the code to javascript
    * ```npm install -g typescript```

 * **forever** using following command : **forever** is used to daemonize the process
    * ```npm install forever -g```

###	Execution on localhost

*	Download and unzip **T-web API Repository**
    *	https://chatelite.xoriant.com/t-webapi.zip

*	Go to **T-web API Repository**
    *	```npm install```  
        (Prefer installing node modules with administrator privileges from terminal.)
    *	```npm link```

*	Start **Mongo server**
    
    * Go to the folder where your Mongo binaries are installed.
        * Your_MongoDB_Folder/bin/mongod.exe
        * For [Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#start-your-mongodb-database)
        * For [Linux Ubuntu](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/#start-mongodb)
        * For [Linux Red Hat](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/#start-mongodb)
        * For [Mac OS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#id6)

*	Go to [**Service repository**](https://github.com/XoriantOpenSource/ChatEliteService)
    *	```npm install```
        (Prefer installing node modules with administrator privileges from terminal.)
    *   Compile using command ```tsc```;if you are using VSCode you may compile using short cut command Ctrl+Shift+b 
    *	Run the service using command ```node app.js``` or run in debug mode (for development) using VSCode debug command

*	Go to [**Web-UI repository**](https://github.com/XoriantOpenSource/ChatEliteUi)
    *	```npm install```
         (Prefer installing node modules with administrator privileges from terminal.)
    *	```npm start```

*	Go to browser, in the address bar enter https://localhost:1234
This is needed to trust the certificate as ChatElite uses self-signing certificate.

*	For client interface, go to browser, in the address bar enter https://localhost:8080

*	First register user and then login with that credentials.
